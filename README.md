# Autocrew: Where AI Builds Itself

Autocrew is a Python script designed to simplify the process of generating scripts for [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI), a collaborative language AI platform. It automates the creation of CrewAI agent and task scripts based on your specified overall goal, and it can also rank crews based on their suitability for completing a given task.

## Key Features

- **Script Generation**: Autocrew can generate CrewAI agent and task scripts for a specified overall goal. It communicates with the Ollama language model to generate agent details, including roles, goals, backstories, assigned tasks, and delegation abilities. The generated scripts are ready for execution within CrewAI.

- **Ranking Mode**: Autocrew can rank existing crews based on their suitability for a particular task. It collects CSV data files that represent different crews, communicates with Ollama to analyze and rank them, and provides a summary of the ranking.

- **Multiple Script Generation**: You can specify the number of scripts to generate for the same overall goal, allowing you to create multiple versions of your crew for comparison or experimentation.

- **Automatic Execution**: Autocrew can automatically execute the generated scripts within CrewAI, saving you time and effort.

## Prerequisites

Before using Autocrew, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install using `pip`):
  - `argparse`
  - `csv`
  - `io`
  - `json`
  - `requests`
  - `crewai`
  - `langchain_community`
- [Ollama](Ollama.ai)
  - NOTE: Ollama is currently available for Linux and Mac only
  - In order to run Ollama on windows, you need to install the Ubuntu 20.04 distribution within WSL. Please see [this guide](https://www.jeremymorgan.com/blog/generative-ai/how-to-run-llm-local-windows/) for more information.

## Usage

### Script Generation

To generate CrewAI scripts for a specified overall goal, use the following command:

```bash
python3 autocrew.py <overall_goal> [-a] [-m NUM] [-v]
```

- `<overall_goal>`: Specify the overall goal for your crew.
- `-a` (optional): Automatically run the generated script(s) after generation.
- `-m NUM` (optional): Generate NUM number of scripts for the same overall goal.
- `-v` (optional): Enable verbose output for detailed information.

### Ranking Mode

To rank existing crews based on their suitability for a task, use the following command:

```bash
python3 autocrew.py -r <overall_goal> [-v]
```

- `-r`: Activate ranking mode.
- `<overall_goal>`: Specify the overall goal for ranking.
- `-v` (optional): Enable verbose output for detailed information.

## Example

Here's an example of generating CrewAI scripts for a project management task:

```bash
python3 autocrew.py "Project Management" -a -m 3 -v
```

This version includes tools to search and scrape the internet, and allows non local ollama and browserless instances to be used (remote dev)
Its all full of hacks - don't use it :) 

This command generates three CrewAI scripts for the "Project Management" goal, automatically runs them, and provides detailed output.
